## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, don't use the issues page as that page is public for everyone, and that includes malicious users.

Please use one of the following channels, in order of preference:
| Channel    | Address                               |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Telegram   | @jorge_barroso                        |
| Email      | <jorge_barroso_11 at hotmail dot com> |
| Discord    | jorge_barroso#6045                    |

## What to Expect After Reporting a Vulnerability
The aim is to respond to vulnerability reports within 1-2 days.

The time to fix will vary depending on the amount of code changes required, but these will be prioritised over any other issues.

Please provide your GitHub handle if you have an account and I will give you a shout-out in the next release!
